There are some ways to set up Sedna, depends on your use case:
- If you have none Kubernetes environment and don't want to install Kubernetes manually, you can follow [the instruction](./all-in-one.md) to install all-in-one Sedna environment.
- Else you can follow [this instruction](./install.md) to install Sedna on existing Kubernetes cluster.
- Also [there is a local up script](./local-up.md) which is mainly used for developing Sedna, it boots a local Kubernetes cluster and installs Sedna based on local Sedna repository.
